# Market-State-Adaptive-RSI-Multi-Confirmation-Crypto-Trading-Strategy
1. Rational: The cryptocurrency is prone to overbought and oversold and RSI serves as a widely-used indicator for measuring buying and selling power. But using RSI only to generate trading signals is usually ineffective. So the strategy combined Bollinger Bands and MACD as a dual confirmation of trading signals, improving the performance significantly.

2. Optimization Process:
  *Initial trading signals generated by RSI alone were frequent and contained lots of invalid signals.
  *Incorporated Bollinger Bands as dual confirmation of signals generated by RSI but was still ineffective in trending markets.
  *Integrated the Average Directional Index (ADX) to identify market states and applied tailored strategies accordingly.

3. Strategy Discription: In ranging markets, used RSI and Bollinger Bands to generate trading signals. While in trending markets, leveraged MACD to determine trend direction (upward/downward), and adjusted RSI overbought/oversold thresholds to generate signals.

4. Outcomes: Adjusted parameters based on the performance during specific time periods to further enhance its effectiveness. The optimized annualized return increased from 16.09\% to 39.41\%, and the Sharpe ratio also improved from 0.76 to 1.43.
