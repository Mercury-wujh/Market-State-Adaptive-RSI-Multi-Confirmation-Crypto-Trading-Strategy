## Rational
The cryptocurrency is prone to overbought and oversold and RSI serves as a widely-used indicator for measuring buying and selling power. But using RSI only to generate trading signals is usually ineffective. So the strategy combined Bollinger Bands and MACD as a dual confirmation of trading signals, improving the performance significantly.

## Optimization Process
1. Initial trading signals generated by RSI alone were frequent and contained lots of invalid signals.
2. Incorporated Bollinger Bands as dual confirmation of signals generated by RSI but was still ineffective in trending markets.
3. Integrated the Average Directional Index (ADX) to identify market states and applied tailored strategies accordingly.

## Strategy Discription
In ranging markets, used RSI and Bollinger Bands to generate trading signals. While in trending markets, leveraged MACD to determine trend direction (upward/downward), and adjusted RSI overbought/oversold thresholds to generate signals.

## Outcomes
Adjusted parameters based on the performance during specific time periods to further enhance its effectiveness. The optimized annualized return increased from 16.09\% to 39.41\%, and the Sharpe ratio also improved from 0.76 to 1.43.
